# openCARES: tools for vehicle remote emission sensing analysis

For the main CARES website, see <https://cares-project.eu/>.

The **openCARES** R package contains tools to assist with the analysis
of vehicle emission remote sensing data. In time, these tools will
include approaches to analyse traditional vehicle emission remote
sesning, plume-chase and point sampling. The tools focus on the
development of new insights from potenilally complex data sets that will
assist both those working on teh development of these technologies and
end users e.g.Â city authorities who want to better-understand real-world
emissions.
